### Relationships between Entities

1. **Customer** and **Order**

    - A customer can place multiple orders (`Customer.orders` is a list of references to `Order`).
    - Each order belongs to a single customer (`Order.customer_id`).

2. **Order** and **Product**

    - An order can contain multiple products (`Order.products` is a list of objects containing references to `Product`).
    - A product can appear in multiple orders (`Product.orders` is a list of references to `Order`).

3. **Product** and **Category**

    - A product belongs to a single category (`Product.category`).
    - A category can contain multiple products (`Category.products` is a list of references to `Product`).

4. **Product** and **Stock**
    - A product has an associated stock entry (`Stock.product_id`).
    - A stock entry corresponds to a single product (`Stock.product_id`).

### Example JSON Representation

#### Customer

```json
{
    "customer_id": "CUST12345",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "address": "123 Main St, Anytown, AT 12345",
    "phone_number": "123-456-7890",
    "orders": ["ORDER123", "ORDER456"]
}
```

#### Order

```json
{
    "order_id": "ORDER123",
    "customer_id": "CUST12345",
    "order_date": "2024-06-19T00:00:00Z",
    "status": "Processing",
    "products": [
        {
            "product_id": "PROD123",
            "quantity": 2,
            "price": 9.99
        },
        {
            "product_id": "PROD456",
            "quantity": 1,
            "price": 19.99
        }
    ],
    "total_amount": 39.97
}
```

#### Product

```json
{
    "product_id": "PROD123",
    "name": "Coffee Bean",
    "description": "Premium quality coffee beans",
    "price": 9.99,
    "category": "CAT123",
    "orders": ["ORDER123", "ORDER789"]
}
```

#### Category

```json
{
    "category_id": "CAT123",
    "name": "Beverages",
    "description": "All kinds of beverages",
    "products": ["PROD123", "PROD456"]
}
```

#### Stock

```json
{
    "product_id": "PROD123",
    "quantity_available": 100,
    "last_updated": "2024-06-19T00:00:00Z"
}
```

This modified architecture includes stock management with the new `Stock` entity, while maintaining appropriate relationships between entities to ensure a coherent and efficient data structure.
